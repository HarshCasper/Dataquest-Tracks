## 3. Converting Categorical Variables ##

# Convert a single column from text categories to numbers
col = pandas.Categorical(income["workclass"])
income["workclass"] = col.codes
print(income["workclass"].head(5))
for name in ["education", "marital_status", "occupation", "relationship", "race", "sex", "native_country", "high_income"]:
    col = pandas.Categorical(income[name])
    income[name] = col.codes

## 5. Creating Splits ##

# Enter your code here
# Enter your code here
private_incomes = income[income["workclass"] == 4]
public_incomes = income[income["workclass"] != 4]

print(private_incomes.shape)
print(public_incomes.shape)

## 9. Overview of Data Set Entropy ##

import math
# We'll do the same calculation we did above, but in Python
# Passing in 2 as the second parameter to math.log will take a base 2 log
entropy = -(2/5 * math.log(2/5, 2) + 3/5 * math.log(3/5, 2))
print(entropy)
prob_0 = income[income["high_income"] == 0].shape[0] / income.shape[0]
prob_1 = income[income["high_income"] == 1].shape[0] / income.shape[0]
income_entropy = -(prob_0 * math.log(prob_0, 2) + prob_1 * math.log(prob_1, 2))

## 11. Information Gain ##

import numpy

def calc_entropy(column):
    """
    Calculate entropy given a pandas series, list, or numpy array.
    """
    # Compute the counts of each unique value in the column
    counts = numpy.bincount(column)
    # Divide by the total column length to get a probability
    probabilities = counts / len(column)
    
    # Initialize the entropy to 0
    entropy = 0
    # Loop through the probabilities, and add each one to the total entropy
    for prob in probabilities:
        if prob > 0:
            entropy += prob * math.log(prob, 2)
    
    return -entropy

# Verify that our function matches our answer from earlier
entropy = calc_entropy([1,1,0,0,1])
print(entropy)

information_gain = entropy - ((.8 * calc_entropy([1,1,0,0])) + (.2 * calc_entropy([1])))
print(information_gain)
income_entropy = calc_entropy(income["high_income"])

median_age = income["age"].median()

left_split = income[income["age"] <= median_age]
right_split = income[income["age"] > median_age]

age_information_gain = income_entropy - ((left_split.shape[0] / income.shape[0]) * calc_entropy(left_split["high_income"]) + ((right_split.shape[0] / income.shape[0]) * calc_entropy(right_split["high_income"])))

## 12. Finding the Best Split ##
